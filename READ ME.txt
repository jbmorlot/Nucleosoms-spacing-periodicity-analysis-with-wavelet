INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM

PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM:

Analyse the local period and the local width from the position of nucleosoms


HOW TO LAUNCH THE PROGRAM:

[-] For interactive Start ( with a window to enter data ): --> Recommended version
	./launch.sh -I ""
	Then fill the fields

[-] For Non Interactive Start (for clusters for exemple):
	Open launch.sh and change directly the parameters on the file, then type in a terminal
	./launch.sh -N "/path_to_the_file/file.wig" Number_or_string
	with Number_or_string a number or a string which will be inserted in the output file name print_no_interaction(Number_or_string).txt
		--> allow you to follow multiple parallel launch of the program 
	if you want to check the progress of the work, type in another terminal (in repertory/PRINT): 
	tail -f print_no_interactive.txt


IF THE PROGRAM CRASH:

You can restart the program where it crashed with:

	./launch.sh -R "/path_to_the_file/file.wig"
OR
	./launch.sh -I ""
	Then select your previous data file and Click on "Restart"

In both case, the parameters of the previous simulation will be loaded.


DATA FORMAT:

The program accept ONLY histogram of the position of nucleosom (1 bin per line) and NOT directly the postion of all nucleosom!


DESCRIPTION OF THE PARAMETERS:

launch_all= 0 OR 1	--> Compute all files in the same repertory selected ( Be careful of undesired file! ) 0:No 1:Yes
data_min > 0 		--> First line of the histogram to be read	
data_max > data_min	--> Last line of the histogram to be read
period_min > 0		--> Period Minimal
period_max > period_min	--> Period Maxial
width_min > 0		--> Width Minimal
width_max > width_min	--> Width Maximal
bin_period > 0 		--> Bin size for the study of the period ( Warning: (period max - period min)/bin period have to be an integer! )
plot= 0 OR 1		--> Display the plots 0:No 1:Yes
save= 0 OR 1		--> Save the plots 0:No 1:Yes
save_txt= 0 OR 1	--> Save the data into text files 0:No 1:Yes
multiprocess= 0 OR 1	--> Activate the multiprocessing (much faster!) 0:No 1:Yes
local_var= 0 OR 1	--> Plot the Local Signal + Local Period + Local Width 0:No 1:Yes
global_var= 0 OR 1	--> Plot the Histograms of Period + Histograms of Width 0:No 1:Yes


NEEDED LIBRAIRIES

Python (at least 2.7)
Scipy (last version):
	pip install scipy
	pip install scipy --upgrade
Numpy (last version):
	pip install numpy
	pip install numpy --upgrade
Matplotlib (last version):
	pip install matplotlib
	pip install matplotlib --upgrade
Psutil (last version)
	pip install psutil
	pip install psutil --upgrade

Note: If you are running on a public machine, you can install a virtual environnement, which allow to install librairies without using root (--> See virtualenv documentation)


PRECOMPUTE

It is a small program which to give an histogram of the positions from a data file. 

To launch it: 	
		./launch_precompute.sh "/path_to_the_file/file" 

 It has to be modified in each case:
	open precompute.py and change the function Operation_on_column (warning: column[0] = 1st column of your data file)

In the launch_precompute.sh you can change the option launch all (0:Yes 1:No)
	--> It will compute every file in the repertory (even repertory, so be careful to have only your files)
